            Many researchers doubt that the familiar car can continue on the course developed over the past half-century or more.<div> Environmental and resource problems from the manufacture, operation, and disposal of cars will require major changes in vehicle design and manufacturing methods</div>, and in the materials and fuels used. Growing world car ownership is increasing both road congestion and traffic fatalities, and both factors could also influence future car design. At the same time, advances in Information Technology appear to offer new approaches to vehicle design, congestion, and safety. This paper briefly examines the various factors that will shape future vehicle design, fuels, infrastructure, and industry. We find that forecasting what will happen in any of these areas is becoming an increasingly difficult task, although some trends have appeared which provide some degree of insight.
